## Generalmusic GEM

EPROMs, Operating System (Firmware), were used in the earlier GEM equipment, (plus later models like Digital Real Pianos) and also some of the LEM range.

Whilst this is not a definitive list (as it may expand), a number of firmware revisions and updates maybe shown below. Please review the latest, or one matching your version. If updating to a later version, you MUST update ALL the set of EPROMs.

An information table for these EPROMs can be found at https://gem-club.com/software-eprom-information/
