**Generalmusic GEM**

----

EPROMs, Operating System (Firmware), were used in the earlier GEM equipment, (plus later models like Digital Real Pianos) and also some of the LEM range.

Whilst this is not a definitive list (as it may expand), a number of firmware revisions and updates maybe shown below. Please review the latest, or one matching your version. If updating to a later version, you MUST update ALL the set of EPROMs.

An information table for these EPROMs can be found at https://gem-club.com/software-eprom-information/
